For automated Post-addition every hour, we need:
(i) A Jenkins job with 'Build Periodically Schedule' Build trigger activated with CRON format '0 * * * *'
(ii) A declarative script written for putting a random text in title/content, written in Python or Groovy or Shell script
(iii) Credentials to the Wordpress site saved in Jenkins
(iv) Need to have our JDK and Ant/Maven configured to our Job for building artifact
(v) We can use the Plug-in 'Deploy to Container' for automatic deployment process
